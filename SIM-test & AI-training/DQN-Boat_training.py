# ---------- Reinforcement Learning (DQN) Tutorial ----------
# (https://docs.pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/reinforcement_q_learning.html)

# This tutorial shows how to use PyTorch to train a Deep Q Learning (DQN) agent
  # on the CartPole-v1 task from Gymnasium.

# -- Task --

# The agent has to decide between two actions - moving the cart left or right - so that the pole
  # attached to it stays upright. You can find more information about
  # the environment and other more challenging environments at Gymnasium’s website.

# As the agent observes the current state of the environment and chooses an action,
  # the environment transitions to a new state, and also returns a reward that indicates 
  # the consequences of the action. In this task, rewards are +1 for every incremental 
  # timestep and the environment terminates if the pole falls over too far or 
  # the cart moves more than 2.4 units away from center. This means better performing 
  # scenarios will run for longer duration, accumulating larger return.

# The CartPole task is designed so that the inputs to the agent are 4 real values
  # representing the environment state (position, velocity, etc.). We take these 4 inputs
  # without any scaling and pass them through a small fully-connected network with 2 outputs,
  # one for each action. The network is trained to predict the expected value for each action,
  # given the input state. The action with the highest expected value is then chosen.

# -- Packages --

# First, let’s import needed packages. Firstly, we need gymnasium for the environment,
  # installed by using pip. This is a fork of the original OpenAI Gym project and maintained 
  # by the same team since Gym v0.19.

# We’ll also use the following from PyTorch:

# - neural networks (torch.nn)
# - optimization (torch.optim)
# - automatic differentiation (torch.autograd)

# ----- Replay Memory -----

# We’ll be using experience replay memory for training our DQN. 
  # It stores the transitions that the agent observes, allowing us to reuse this data later.
  # By sampling from it randomly, the transitions that build up a batch are decorrelated. 
  # It has been shown that this greatly stabilizes and improves the DQN training procedure.

# For this, we’re going to need two classes:

# - Transition - a named tuple representing a single transition in our environment. 
  # It essentially maps (state, action) pairs to their (next_state, reward) result,
  # with the state being the screen difference image as described later on.

# - ReplayMemory - a cyclic buffer of bounded size that holds the transitions observed recently.
  # It also implements a .sample() method for selecting a random batch of transitions for training.

Transition = namedtuple('Transition',('state', 'action', 'next_state', 'reward'))

# ----- Q-network -----

# Our model will be a feed forward neural network that takes in the difference 
  # between the current and previous screen patches. It has two outputs, 
  # representing Q(s,left) and Q(s,right) (where ss is the input to the network). 
  # In effect, the network is trying to predict the expected return of taking 
  # each action given the current input.

# ----- Training -----

# --- Hyperparameters and utilities ---

# This cell instantiates our model and its optimizer, and defines some utilities:

# - select_action - will select an action according to an epsilon greedy policy. 
  # Simply put, we’ll sometimes use our model for choosing the action,
  # and sometimes we’ll just sample one uniformly. The probability of choosing
  # a random action will start at EPS_START and will decay exponentially towards EPS_END.
  # EPS_DECAY controls the rate of the decay.

# - plot_durations - a helper for plotting the duration of episodes,
  # along with an average over the last 100 episodes (the measure used in the official evaluations). 
  # The plot will be underneath the cell containing the main training loop, 
  # and will update after every episode.

# BATCH_SIZE is the number of transitions sampled from the replay buffer
# GAMMA is the discount factor as mentioned in the previous section
# EPS_START is the starting value of epsilon
# EPS_END is the final value of epsilon
# EPS_DECAY controls the rate of exponential decay of epsilon, higher means a slower decay
# TAU is the update rate of the target network
# LR is the learning rate of the ``AdamW`` optimizer

# ----- Training loop -----

# Finally, the code for training our model.

# Here, you can find an optimize_model function that performs a single step of the optimization.
  # It first samples a batch, concatenates all the tensors into a single one,
  # computes Q(st,at) and V(st+1)=max⁡aQ(st+1,a),
  # and combines them into our loss. By definition we set V(s)=0V(s)=0 if ss is a terminal state.
  # We also use a target network to compute V(st+1)V(st+1​) for added stability. 
  # The target network is updated at every step with a soft update controlled by 
  # the hyperparameter TAU, which was previously defined.
